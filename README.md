# Project Repository Template

## Overview

This repository serves as a template to structure and organize your data analysis projects. It outlines a standard directory layout, ensuring that data, scripts, and results are neatly compartmentalized for ease of use and reproducibility.

## Repository Structure

### Folders

- **code/**: This directory contains all the code scripts used in the project. The `main.py` is the primary script that orchestrates the execution of the project, potentially calling upon subsidiary scripts.

- **data/**: Houses raw, immutable data files used in the analysis. It is a fundamental practice to keep raw data unmodified to ensure the reproducibility of the analysis.

- **documents/**: Contains all the documentation related to the project, including but not limited to project proposals, technical reports, and analysis summaries.

- **output/**: Stores all the outputs generated by the scripts, such as processed data, figures, and tables, reflecting the end results of the data analysis pipeline.

### Files

- **.git/**: Hidden folder that contains Git configuration and history, tracking the changes made over time and managing version control.

- **.gitignore**: Lists the files and directories that Git should ignore and not track, such as compiled Python files (`*.pyc`), log files, or local configuration files.

- **LICENSE**: Specifies the licensing agreement for the project, clarifying how this work can be used by others in commercial and non-commercial settings.

- **README.md**: Provides an overview and documentation for the project, explaining the purpose, structure, usage, and any other essential information for collaborators.

- **environment.yml**: For Conda users, this file allows for the easy creation of an environment that mirrors the projectâ€™s dependencies. Generate/overwrite with `conda env export > environment.yml`

- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the necessary packages/libraries and their respective versions required for the project, enabling the recreation of the virtual environment used for development. Generate/overwrite with `pip freeze > requirements.txt `
